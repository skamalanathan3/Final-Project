### Listed down below are tasks we will complete by the end of the term:

### User interface will have input fields for wages and expenses and code function will carry out calculations
* All caclulations will carry out successfully and values be stored into the database
* Calculation will add up all values and display a value of the total sum available considering the previous days values

### Display and create Query report for all dates in current month or a month the user selects
* Will successfully create a query report 
* In the query field, there may be fields such as the dates selected

### Display sales between two dates choosen by user and compare the two
*  Drop down calender to display calender that will allow user to choose two dates
*  Math function to compare

### Display and create Query report for selected dates
