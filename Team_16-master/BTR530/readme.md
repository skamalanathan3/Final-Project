## System Description
We would like to take an existing sales report and employee tracking system for clients which take manual inputs in Microsoft Excel and upgrade it so that it becomes an automated online system. The excel calculates or tracks the following: 
*	Daily Sale
    * Cash Sale
    * Debit Sale 
    * Total Sale
    * Till Denominations 
    * Total Cash in till
*	Employee Hours and Wages
*	Expense 

All the information is entered manually and some information is calculated by math formulas. The risk of that is the formula is accessible and can be changed by accident. There is also no tracking of activity for a logging system of what is being done. With the current system in place there are a lot of flaws and human error possibilities. 
Our system will keep all the same information and calculations but attempt to make it online. We will also add a reporting mechanism that will do comparison for different data analysis and display it to the user. Using PHP and MySQL we look to develop our web app.

## Description of Prototype to be delivered in BTS530

Our goal is to deliver the prototype system that will track daily sale information, employee tracking, reports with specified timeframe to comparison and analysis. This is the main core of the system. As per request we are adding a inventory/job order list where the user will manually enter the item into the list for future tracking to see if the job/order was completed.
